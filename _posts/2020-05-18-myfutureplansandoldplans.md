It's 4:20 AM (ha!) right now and I'm sitting here typing away on VSCODE. Why? I just learned how to "use jekyll" and I'm f█ █ █ ing stoked. Keep in mind, the only websites I've made are new tab startpages and funny html files that replay the same laughing dog gif — so I'm sure you can see why I'm EXCITED BEYOND BELIEF but I also apologize for how nonsensical the following will sound.

Anyways, you may think that this post is about the beginning of this blog but **no!** 

This is in fact a post about ONE OK ROCK and their [song, The Beginning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hh9yZWeTmVM). I'm not actually that big of a OKR fan but I do enjoy some of their songs, one of them being [Bombs Away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke47h0x_TLs). I am in love with song not just because of its lyrics (one's that scream a story of redemption) but because they remind me of a very important person to me.

I played this song on spotify on repeat in my second year of highschool, I was obsessed with it. The lyrics screamed to me, a timid tenth grader who was doing poorly in Science and Math, that I could rise above my failures, my struggles, my trials and tribulations. During this time I started talking to one of my now closest friends, someone 3 years older than me, my mentor and idol. He was everything I wanted to be, in my desired university program at the time, had the highest average in his class and good looking too. I strongly associate this song as a call to rise up for me but also a melodic symbol for him.

*Tick tick tock and it’s bombs away*

Each line screams urgency, I needed to act and become the best version of me I could. The clock was counting down and the date was to November 27th, 2017 —  the SHAD Valley Application Deadline. Every second I wasn't asleep, I was thinking about my SHAD application. My idol went to SHAD, I needed to go as well. That song played in the background during every essay writing session. When the deadline reached, I was a free man. Well, until acceptances came out. 

But that's enough of SHAD, this blog is about ONE ROCK.

To be honest, I've only listened to Bombs Away and their other hit songs, I've never listened to THe Beginning, that was just an excuse to talk about SHAD and Bombs Away in my first post.

Thanks for reading! Come again!

btw. i got into shad so dw. the story carries on.
